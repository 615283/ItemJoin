#// See https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html for item names! //#
#// See this enchantments page for the correct enchant name. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html //#
#// Need some more help with item slots? See the Documentations page for a more in-depth tutorial. http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/itemjoin/pages/documentation //#
#// For per-world support this best works with Multiverse-Inventories! http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/multiverse-inventories //#
#// Otherwise you will need to set clear-on-world-changed to true if you want to get the new items when you change worlds. //#
#// Then you will need to add itemflag world-changed to each item to receive the new items. //#
items-Version: 4

Global-Settings: #// Global Settings, for each world listed under world-list. These will take effect in them. //#
  Prevention:
    prevent-pickups: false #// Prevents picking up of any item //#
    AllowOPBypass: false #// Ignores these settings under Prevention if you are OP //#
    CreativeBypass: false #// Ignores these settings under Prevention if you are in creative mode. //#
  Clear-On:
    clear-on-join: false #// Clears the players inventory upon entering the server. (Before items are given). //#
    clear-on-world-change: false #// Clears the players inventory upon changing worlds. (Before items are given). //#
    AllowOPBypass: false #// Ignores these settings under Clear-On if you are OP //#
  First-Join:
    FirstJoin-Mode-Enabled: false #// Set to true if you wish to use First-Join-Item: true per item! (This allows the use of the First Join options). //#
  Get-Items:
    ItemJoin-Specific-Items: true #// This meaning, these items are specific to ItemJoin and cannot be renamed to. Usually you would disable this if you had another plugin that hooks into ItemJoin items. //#
    Global-Items: false #// Setting this to true will make it so you can define items to work on ALL worlds listed under world-list. This means instead of defining a world for each world listed under world-list, you would simply just use the text global in  place of world name. //#
    Delay: 2 #// Set to 0 to disable. Recommended is 2 especially if you use First-Join! (This is in Seconds.) //#

world-list: #// This is the list of worlds that have custom items on join. //#
  - world
  - world_nether

#// For every world listed in the world-list, you need to make a section for it. //#
#// NOTE: It is only required to have the ID and Slot listed under each item to receive it. //#
world: #// This is the first section, This is the name of the world you want to receive the items in. If Global-Items was enabled this would be named global. //#
  items: #// This is just an identifier to list out the items. This must always be here //#
    ultra-item: #// This is the name of the first item we have created, you can name it what ever you want! Just put the NAME and then a colon. Such as New-Name: //#
      id: DIAMOND_SWORD #// This is the Material name OR item ID of the item you want to get //#
      slot: 0 #// This is the slot number you want to receive the item in. Available slots are 0-35, Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Offhand, or Arbitrary. //#
      name: '&bUltra Sword' #// This is the custom name of the item. Supports color codes as well as placeholders from PlaceholderAPI! //#
      data-value: 0 #// This is the data-value that is after the items ID. Usually it is left as 0, but in cases of items like Stained Glass it would need to be set to a number. It is default 0 if a data-value is not specified. //#
      count: 1 #// This is the amount of each item that will be given. You will be given 1 Diamond Sword. //#
      lore: #// This is the custom lore of the item. This is just the identifier which is required to start the lore. //#
        - '&7Useless sword, cannot do much' #// This is the first line of custom lore. You can add multiple lines by copying and pasting it how it is shown below. //#
        - '&7Only useful for commands...'
        - '&7Maybe you should try removing the'
        - '&7Left click and physical actions from the command actions.'
        - '&7Maybe remove the cancel-events from itemflags as well...'
      enchantment: #// This is the custom enchantments. Just an identifier again that is required to start the enchantment list. //#
        - 'FIRE_ASPECT:3' #// The enchantments can be setup the exact same as the lore. Multiple lines can be added. The syntax for enchantments are the ENCHANTMENT_NAME:LEVEL. //#
        - 'KNOCKBACK:8' #// This is another line of enchantment. Supports unsafe enchants! //#
      commands: #// These are custom commands that can be bound to items. So once you click the item these commands will execute. These also support placeholders. //#
        - 'message: &eYou can send yourself custom messages!' #// This is a custom message that can be sent to the player who right-clicked it. //#
        - 'console: say You can even execute more than one command!' #// This is a command that can be executed by console. //#
        - 'player: say This is item slot 2' #// This is a command that is executed by the player. //#
        - 'say I like pancakes!' #// If no executer is defined such as message, console, or player. Then it will be executed by player by default. This is a player command. //#
      commands-action: RIGHT_CLICK_AIR, RIGHT_CLICK_BLOCK, LEFT_CLICK_AIR, LEFT_CLICK_BLOCK, PHYSICAL #// These are command actions. These are all self-explanatory. If you need more help see the documentations page. //#
      commands-cost: 25 #// This is the amount of in game money it will cost to run all the commands. You must have vault enabled and installed to use this. //#
      commands-cooldown: 5 #// This is the amount of time in seconds that the player has to wait before executing the commands again. //#
      cooldown-message: '&7[&eItemJoin&7] &a[%item%&a] &cis on cooldown for &a%timeleft% &cseconds..' #// If a player attempts to execute the commands while they're is on cooldown, this cooldown message will be sent to the player. //#
      itemflags: #// These are custom itemflags! These allow huge modifications to the items. All itemflags with description are listed below. //#
        - 'unbreakable' #// Makes this item INDESTRUCTABLE! //#
        - 'hide-attributes' #// Hides ALL attributes, such as firework color, damage the item does, enchantments. (Hides everything from lore except the custom lore). //#
