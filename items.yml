      commands:
        - 'gamemode 1 %player%' #// Also supports the variable %player%. The end result would be /gamemode 1 XSilverSlayerX. Only if I was the one to click the item though. //#

        - 'say i am a command' #// Same for this line. Remove it. //#
    5:
      id: STAINED_GLASS
      data-value: 12 #// Support for data-values. This is the ending number of the item ID. Since brown stained glass is 95:12 we would put 12. So you would get STAINED_GLASS:12. //#
      count: 32
      commands:
        - 'server survival' #// Supports BungeeCord too! (Since its in instance of the player). //#
    9:
      id: COMPASS
      data-value: 0 #// Default data value for an item is 0. So since this is a compass you can just remove the data-value line.
